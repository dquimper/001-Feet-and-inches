= Feet and inches

Drawing programs measure distances in ten-thousandths of an inch, like 73.0185, but carpenters work in feet, inches, and thirty-seconds of an inch, like 6 feet 1 and 1/32 inches. Your task is to write a program that takes a measurement in decimal notation and returns the measurement in carpenterâ€™s notation.

If you are unfamiliar with imperial measurements, you need to know that there are twelve inches in a foot.

For example:

  0       =>  0 feet 0 inches
  0.2785  =>  9/32 inch
  1.6895  =>  1 and 11/16 inches
 11.9999  =>  1 foot
 12.2785  =>  1 foot 9/32 inch
 71.9999  =>  6 feet
 72       =>  6 feet
 72.3492  =>  6 feet 11/32 inch
 72.9999  =>  6 feet 1 inch
 73       =>  6 feet 1 inch
 73.0135  =>  6 feet 1 inch
 73.0185  =>  6 feet 1 and 1/32 inches
 73.8218  =>  6 feet 1 and 13/16 inches

* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
